Open VisualStudio Developer shell and run:
verify that cl is 65 bits:
cl /?
to build all files in a folder, move to the destination folder and call the compile from there:

pushd build
cl /EHsc /LD ..\CpuStressSVC.cpp /link advapi32.lib /OUT:CpuStressSVC.dll
popd
copy .\build\CpuStressSVC.dll C:\svc\


Advanced build:

cl /EHsc /LD CpuStressSVC.cpp `
   /Fo build\CpuStressSVC.obj `
   /link /OUT:build\CpuStressSVC.dll `
         /IMPLIB:build\CpuStressSVC.lib `
         /PDB:build\CpuStressSVC.pdb `
         /EXP:build\CpuStressSVC.exp


Explanation of the extra switches

/Fo path           – tell the compiler where to place the .obj
/IMPLIB:path       – tell the linker where to place the .lib
/PDB:path          – optional, keeps the debug database with the rest
(If you also want the .exp file next to the others, add
/EXP:build\CpuStressSVC.exp ; normally you can omit it because it is only an
intermediate file.)
